## 🧾 Project Overview

The dataset contains over 19,000 FIFA 22 players, each described by 110 attributes. For analysis, 20 key numerical and categorical features were selected (e.g. league, nationality, age, skill ratings).

The project consists of the following stages:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualizations of feature relationships (league, age, position, etc.)
   - Dimensionality reduction with PCA

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - Linear regression (custom implementation, scikit-learn, PyTorch)
   - `RandomForestRegressor`, `SVR`, `DecisionTreeRegressor`
   - MSE-based comparison of model accuracy

3. **Model Optimization**  
   - Cross-validation (KFold)
   - Polynomial feature expansion (degrees 1–10) and convergence analysis
   - L1/L2 regularization
   - Data balancing (SMOTE, undersampling)
   - Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV

4. **Ensemble Methods**  
   - `VotingRegressor`, `StackingRegressor`, `Mixture of Experts`
   - **Best performance achieved by Mixture of Experts**

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- `scikit-learn`
- `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`
- `PyTorch`
- `imbalanced-learn` (SMOTE)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Results

- The **Mixture of Experts** model achieved the lowest MSE by dynamically weighting individual expert predictions per sample.
- Linear models performed adequately but struggled with capturing complex relationships.
- Tree-based models (RandomForest, DecisionTree) handled non-linearity effectively.
- Ensemble methods like Voting and Stacking did not outperform the best single model.
